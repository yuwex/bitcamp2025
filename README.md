# Bytecamp

Welcome to Bytecamp! You are Joe HackaThon, and your goal is to build the best possible project you can (or do side-quests the whole time).

Here, you stuck in the Redford Armory for 36 hours (36 minutes IRL), where you can walk around talking to sponsors, collecting new hardware, attending workshops, working on your project, or refueling with food. Your goal is to maximize your personal stats (Energy, Morale, Hunger, IQ, and Communication) as well as your project stats (Technicality, Originality, User Friendliness). But, you can't have it all! Every 15 seconds, a couple events will pop up on your screen. After choosing what event you want to focus on, you are presented with multiple options that may increase or decrease certain stats! Choose carefully...
